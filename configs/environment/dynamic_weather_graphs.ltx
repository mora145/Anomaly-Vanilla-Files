; support for Weather cycles and presets

; Every cycle has presets, those presets represent the weather files (match their names so the script will read them correctly)
; You can have as much as you want of cycles and presets for them

; Example of weather preset/profile: w_cloudy.ltx
; Naming rule: w_(cycle preset)_(moon pharse)
; Directory: environment\weathers\

; cycle preset: a name of your choice, its better to have the cycle name included. like foggy_01 and foggy_02
; moon pharse: only needed for clear and partly presets, used to detemind the moon pharse for the weather preset
; NOTE: add your new presets to [dof_kernels] section too, this will help with extra weather effects based on preset parameters (and prevent crashes)
