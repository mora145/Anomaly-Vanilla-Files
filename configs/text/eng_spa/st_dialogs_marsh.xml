		<text>I found a flight recorder.</text>

	<string id="find_blackbox_mlr_reward_csky_1">
		<text>Ah, an excellent find! Perhaps we'll finally find the cause of these air raids in the marshes.</text>

		<text>What can you tell me about Cold?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_1">
		<text>What can I say? He's earned quite a bit of respect as the current leader of our organization.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_2">
		<text>How did he earn that respect?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_3">
		<text>You see, there was some controversy regarding Lebedev, our former leader - who, by the way, I personally never met - and he didn't seem to take the opinions of the faction members into account during their crusade towards the CNPP. That mercenary certainly helped us out, but in the end, it just wasn't worth it. Those who remained at the base were unable to fight back against a resurgence made by the Renegades. The significance of our struggle in the swamps was reduced to zero... and the sacrifices on the way to the Chernobyl NPP, as well as the swamps, turned out to be in vain.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_4">
		<text>It seems like the faction's resentment towards their leader at that time was justified.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_5">
		<text>There's more to it... After our troops had returned, we had to start a long war to take everything back. We wouldn't be able to manage in day-to-day life without Cold. He received some help from unaffiliated stalkers and got in touch with people throughout the Garbage and the Cordon. Free stalkers helped us out, and having a charismatic leader certainly didn't hurt. Moreover, he's given an order to all fighters - without exceptions - not to leave here. We'll take any help, but we won't risk the lives of our guys.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_6">
		<text>Whoever Lebedev was and what he did, you aren't the same faction you used to be.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_b_cs_7">
		<text>That's your opinion. Certainly has some value to it. Right now, we have no large-scale goals, except for maybe...er... Anyway, it's probably time we cut the storytelling and start the trading.</text>

	<string id="story_dog_1">
		<text>That's Buddy, the Doctor's dog. Doctor asked Cold to keep him safe, as he's started getting a little old.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_2">
		<text>Well, by the looks of it, you wouldn't say that he needs it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_3">
		<text>Looks can be deceiving sometimes. This pet is a kind-hearted creature. Now, can I tell you something interesting about this kind of dog?</text>

	<string id="story_dog_4">
		<text>Adelante.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_5">
		<text>Pseudodogs don't actually descend from dogs at all, although they share the same ancient ancestor. They kind of originate from wolves - Duty learned that while researching them.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_6">
		<text>And how did you come to know this?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_7">
		<text>By virtue of my profession, I collect all sorts of stories. To the north, there's a place similar to our swamps called Zaton. I've heard there's an old crank that lives in the old barge, and apparently, he also has a pseudodog. Perhaps you can find out if it's true, if the distance doesn't bother you.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="story_dog_8">
		<text>It's only the entire length of the Zone. Maybe I'll pop over there sometime.</text>

		<text>I spoke to Noah - that "old crank" you mentioned earlier.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_dog_marsh_part_two_1">
		<text>Oh, I completely forgot about that. So is it true - has he also tamed a pseudodog?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_dog_marsh_part_two_2">
		<text>S&#237;. He calls her Lassie. She's got two puppies, and they haven't shown any kind of aggressive behaviour.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="about_dog_marsh_part_two_3">
		<text>Puppies? Never thought you'd ever see that in the Zone. Well, thanks - now I know that there are more friendly pseudodogs breeding in the Zone. Here are some provisions for your future journeys... And, if you need it, you can have some information about a route between the Army Warehouses and the Red Forest. It's remained with us like an echo from the past.</text>

		<text>&#191;Yo? Well, I've been Clear Sky's guide for over seven years now. That said, during my earlier years, like 2011, I mostly stuck to the marshes, only rarely taking stalkers further. But that was a different time, before they found that damned mercenary in the reeds with a mouth full of swamp water. \nOur leaders didn't trust him - they had me blindfold him every time he wanted to enter or leave our base. And then within only a few weeks he'd somehow managed to convince them, along with most of our men, to charge into the power station. \nNeedless to say neither he nor much of our faction came back from that madness. All because of that fuckin' crazy merc.</text>

		<text>You're talking about Scar?</text>

	<string id="mar_csky_guide_background_3">
		<text>The legendary, yes. More than his scar I remember his creepy eyes, though. That guy was seriously freaking me out. Professor Kalancha told us that he was somehow resistant to emissions. Not just that, he got stronger each time one hit him. Had his brain fried, too. Seems like he didn't survive the giant one at the CNPP party, at any rate. Serves him right.</text>

		<text>Clear Sky is big on research, right?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="marsh_stalker_tech_pragmatic_research_1">
		<text>We sure are. Like the Ecologists, we keep trying to understand the Zone better but we don't just observe. We prefer to use the knowledge we gain for practical applications. For example, shards of a Gravi artefact embedded in body armour significantly reduce its weight. The bloodsucker's coagulant can be implemented in a life support system that prevents blood loss during combat. And the resolving capacity of the Flesh's eye helped us develop advanced targeting systems. That's just some of the many ideas we've come up with.</text>

He was saying something about the Monolith, I didn't understand much of it and I'm not too sure he did either. Toma, c&#243;gelo. One more thing... He spent a lot of time searching for clues of a conspiracy in underground labs, some kind of secret cover-up I believe. Perhaps you'll find your answers there.</text>

        <text>Well, I am Professor E.F. Kalancha. Alongside Lebedev and Suslov I was one of the founding members of Clear Sky. Unlike them, may they rest in peace, I stayed behind in the Hidden Base during their fateful raid on the Chernobyl NPP. I am the faction's head researcher. Most of the time I conduct experiments on artefacts, study mutant tissue samples and observe anomalies. Sometimes I cooperate with Novikov to find practical applications for the results of my work. Moreover, out of necessity I have also become the local medic. If you return injured from an excursion or, preferably, with some rare specimen in your bag, well, you know where to find me.</text>

    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_people_1">
        <text>Many people think they understand what the Zone truly is. Sadly, they are all mistaken. Some think it is a manifestation of pure evil, others call it a miracle, while certain people can only think of all the riches they might obtain... They are all misguided by basic human prejudices. The Zone is an incomprehensible phenomenon when viewed through the prism of human perception. Far too early for us to even try. Both stalkers and the government act recklessly in their ignorance. We did as well, once, thinking our knowledge superior to everyone else's, and paid dearly for that.</text>
    </string>

    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_zone_0">
        <text>What do you know about the Zone?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_zone_1">
        <text>Young man, we have been studying the Zone for several years now but remain none the wiser. I can tell you that the Zone is definitely not a natural phenomenon but rather the result of... a futile endeavour devised by some overly ambitious people. We are unable to reverse its effects. The Zone cannot be destroyed, nor will it disappear of its own accord. Furthermore, experience taught us that any attempt to curb or contain it will have catastrophic consequences. Presently we, Clear Sky, believe that there is only one way to reconcile man with the Zone: coexistence.</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_zone_2">
        <text>That would be easier without emissions ravaging the area every few days. Speaking of which, what is causing them in the first place?</text>
    </string>
    <string id="marsh_stalker_medic_about_zone_3">
        <text>How can I best explain? Let's put it like this: any complicated system in nature, and that includes the Zone, automatically seeks equilibrium in the absence of destabilizing external factors. That was the case here a few years ago - the Zone was stable and there were no significant deviations from the norm&#8230; and now? Like you have said, devastating emissions regularly sweep across the Zone. The system became unstable, distorted&#8230; a glitch, of sorts. The Zone is spewing out emission after emission and pumping itself full of energy with each one, so much so that the readings on my sensors oscillate with unbelievable speed! Unfortunately, Lebedev and Suslov were unable to reverse this trend permanently, in spite of their tragic sacrifice. The most important lesson in all this is that this "glitch" is not a product of natural causes either. This is all human handiwork.</text>

As&#237; que cuando ocurri&#243; el resurgimiento del Monolito y los negocios se dirigieron al sur, los seguimos. Consegu&#237; un buen trabajo aqu&#237; despu&#233;s de que Nimble me recomendara a Cold. He was a member of Clear Sky back in the day, y'know? 'Course, Nimble's gone back up to Zaton to help out at the Skadovsk, the madman, but he's left me with a nice little operation here. I now have access to an army-free smuggling route through the swamps, and Clear Sky gets first pick of everything I get my hands on. Pay Nimble a visit if you ever find yourself north of the Barrier. Even now, he's probably still peddling only the rarest weapons and armour to his fellow stalkers. For the right price, he'll set you up with some of the best damn gear in the Zone.</text>

Un buen n&#250;mero todav&#237;a se encontraba en nuestros otros territorios, que m&#225;s tarde quedaron aislados del resto de la Zona por anomal&#237;as posteriores a la emisi&#243;n. Cuando se hizo obvio para aquellos que estaban en los pantanos en ese momento que estaban casi atrapados aqu&#237; sin una salida f&#225;cil, todo se fue al infierno. Honest stalkers became bandits overnight, whilst the rest tried to flee to our base, or live off the area's mutants. We took on a lot of men, and our food stores ensured their loyalty, and after a little while, it became obvious we'd need a new leader. I took on the burden and asked our Librarian to man the bar in my place; he'd earned quite a name for himself in the short time since he joined. After a few months of tit-for-tat raiding with the bandits, we managed to smoke most of them out, but that didn't stop the army from feeling like they needed to move in and finish the job.

		<text>Thing is, we don't have a single goal. Poor Lebedev was an ambitious man. He thought we could discover all of the Zone's dirty little secrets and use the knowledge to tame or contain it. That didn't exactly pan out, though. Nowadays, we do basically the same things we used to do. We hunt mutants, collect artefacts and do some research on them. Every once in a while we recover some interesting documents from an old underground lab. But we don't engage in turf wars with other factions and we definitely don't plan another bold campaign into the heart of the Zone anytime soon. Unlike Duty we don't try to destroy it, and we don't want to open an amusement park here like the folks from Freedom either. For now, we coexist. Better keep a low profile, like the good ol' times before the final raid.</text>
