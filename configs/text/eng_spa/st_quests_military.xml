		<text>One of my best men is currently hiding out among the enemy, trying to learn their secrets. He's usually a solid guy, so when he begins missing our contact times, I begin to worry. I have a hunch he's been ratted out, and that the squad he's with is now quietly waiting for the perfect opportunity to silence him permanently. We need to get him home. He left me a location ping, but he's with other stalkers. You need to take care of them and bring my man back in one piece. You will recognize him by his rifle, an SVD. He will have to shoot at you to maintain his deception when you attack the group, but he won't be aiming too well, so don't hold a grudge.</text>

Look at the rusty, dysfunctional pieces of junk we have rotting in our warehouses! If we can't have tanks that work in the Zone, then neither can the government! My spies say these vehicles are arriving to be stationed at the Cordon checkpoint as we speak. My mole also says he'll guarantee the vehicles are unmanned when you pay your visit, so you can destroy them without being turned into swiss cheese. You want in?

		<text>Sleep has been a little harder around camp lately. Each night we hear screaming, but before we can do anything about it, yet another one of our men on the road gets swallowed by the darkness. We find their mangled remains strewn about the Bloodsucker Village the next day.\n \nLukash thinks a rare breed of bloodsucker may be in town. A darker, stronger, more vicious motherfucker that only comes out at night. A few of the vets think we should cease night hikes until it migrates and hopefully starts messing up Duty instead, believing it's too risky for us to go after it directly.\n \nWell, I say if you've got the stones to wait for it in the Village after nightfall, I'd be thrilled to shower you in roubles for killing the bastard, and the rest of the lads around here will be grateful to get a good night's sleep again.

One is sandwiched between Duty thugs, military goons, and who knows what else. The other is a light jog away from Pripyat. And both...are sponsored by the very government we fight against. We need to start stockpiling new artefact hunting equipment NOW in case either of those places suddenly becomes cut off from our runners. I need you to begin gathering Bear detectors and artefact containers wholesale. I understand everything I'm requesting will take a while to obtain. Don't fret, your payment will be adequate.
