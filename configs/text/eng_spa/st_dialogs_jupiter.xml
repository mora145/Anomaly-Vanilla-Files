<!-- Loki (Freedom Leader) in Yanov -->
	<string id="loki_st_0">
		<text>Are you in charge here?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_1">
		<text>That I am. Name's Loki, right hand of Lukash at this station.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_2">
		<text>Loki? An interesting name - like the Scandinavian deity.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_3">
		<text>It is. That's what they called me in the early days, right around when the Brain Scorcher showed up. Those were crazy times.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_4">
		<text>Could you tell me more about the events after the Scorcher?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_5">
		<text>Claro. When the Scorcher was first shut down back in 2012, my squad launched a campaign towards the north. We went on for some time, going through different places... As the Chernobyl power plant loomed on the horizon, we decided to look for a place to set up camp and found this station while it was empty. Duty arrived soon after. We were duking it out when suddenly an emission struck. You must understand that getting zombified is a pretty shitty way to go, no matter who you are. So, at great risk...I let Duty inside before the storm really got going. We called a building-wide truce, agreeing to keep all weapons holstered and knives sheathed inside this station. We'd still continue to harass each other outside of it, of course.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_6">
		<text>And what happened to the Dutyers stationed here? Where are they now?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_7">
		<text>That's not an easy question. Not long ago, a stalker by the name of Alexander appeared and helped the people here considerably - man did a lot of good things. Thanks to him, everyone was maintaining a careful balance in this station. Faction tensions in the building were even starting to defuse. That is, until the Monolith popped their ugly heads above ground again and started looking in our direction.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_8">
		<text>What happened next?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_9">
		<text>Well, Colonel Shulga - the leader of the Dutyers that were here - decided he wasn't going to stand for cultists running freely across the Zone again. He took as many men as he could, said "Don't worry, we'll be back in time for drinks" and marched straight for Pripyat. The Brain Scorcher reactivated not too long after and...we never saw them since.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_10">
		<text>Was his sacrifice worth it?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="loki_st_11">
		<text>...No. To think of the risks I took when I first let his men in here all those years ago...these days they're probably taking their drinks alongside the brainwashed and the walking dead...</text>

	<string id="jup_trapper_about_retire_1">
		<text>I&#8217;m getting old, man. That&#8217;s why Fox died... He was my partner and friend. We hunted many a beast together, shoulder to shoulder... Then we ran into these two chimeras by Zaton that haven&#8217;t been seen in the Zone for eighteen months... One knocked Fox to the ground before I could even get my shotgun out. When I wounded the other one, they ran off... I hope they burn in hell forever!</text>
	</string>
	
	<string id="st_jup_b220_trapper_life_ask">
		<text>Tell me about hunting mutants...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_jup_b220_trapper_life_1">
		<text>Chimeras are very dangerous nocturnal predators. They try to get behind you under cover of darkness and leap on top of you. If you know there's a chimera around, keep checking your back and cover your friends' asses...</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_jup_b220_trapper_life_2">
		<text>Burers use gravitation attacks... When at close proximity they'll throw you and when they're far away they'll try to throw something at you... Your best bet is to keep them at medium range from you and keep moving, unless you enjoy getting hit by something heavy... But be careful to conserve your energy! Burers can use directed gravitational impulses to yank weapons out of your hands and if you're tired it might just work.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_jup_b220_trapper_life_3">
		<text>There are two types of poltergeists. The first type sends items crashing into the enemy using gravitation, while the second type is the fire poltergeist that uses flames to burn its victims. Inexperienced hunters try to circle around them to evade their attacks... The trick is to know that poltergeists can't see or hear in the usual sense of those words and use that to your advantage. They sense objects that move in the gravitational field... So a seasoned hunter freezes as soon as he sees a poltergeist, fires and then freezes again, rinse repeat.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_jup_b220_trapper_life_4">
		<text>The most difficult thing about hunting pseudogiants is killing them. They can take incredible punishment without so much as batting an eyelid... All I can say is that you may want to try using a shotgun at close range. Just remember that pseudogiant attacks can detach anything that's not been fixed to concrete. Attack it from above... and make sure that whatever you're standing on can withstand some damage.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_jup_b220_trapper_life_5">
		<text>Controllers use your own mind against you. When you're hunting one, it's important to use cover, because it must see you to affect your mind... Also, they're quite slow, so if your life is at stake, use grenades.</text>
	</string>
