		<text>I'm with the military, callsign "Peregrine". We've got troops stationed here to help out with maintaining the equipment. I'm also a part-time technician - if something breaks, I can repair it.</text>

		<text>What's the current situation?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="army_yan_mec_about_tool_3">
		<text>To be honest with you, it's shit. I don't have the tools I need, all thanks to the outstanding supply of the higher-ups. The equipment the Ecologists have got here isn't really making it easy for us, and it's gonna need some higher quality modifications... Managed to get the old receiver here repaired, though it's still spouting a bunch of gibberish. Our guys kicked the bucket at the Army Warehouses a couple of years ago, and it's still transmitting their voices.</text>

		<text>The local cook, I guess. On paper, I'm actually a field asssistant for the Ecologists here. In practice...well, it's been a few months since they sent me out, and I get the feeling I'm not going to be going anywhere any time soon. Anyway, they call me Spirit.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_povar_army_2">
		<text>Why don't they deploy you anymore?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="meet_povar_army_3">
		<text>Just a little misunderstanding. People around here think I'm an alcoholic. I mean, really? With the Monolith being active again, any sane man would be driven to drink while his friends are stuck up in Jupiter. I know they'll probably be fine, but I still worry. Still, if you happen to get your hands on any Nemiroff, I can hook you up with some good stuff... \nWhat do you say? I can offer you four 9x18 mags or two mags of 5.45 for five swigs of Nemiroff, and four mags for ten. \nFor ten swigs, I can share one mag of 7.62mm 7N1, or three boxes of 12x70 shot rounds, your choice. \nFor fifteen swigs - that's about five full bottles - AND 7000 RU, you get three mags of 7.62x54 mm PP rounds. They are quite expensive you know... \nAnd for twenty swigs - just under seven full bottles, I'll fetch you an entire Berill suit from the bins. Don't think I'm a scoundrel... it's not that bad, the lion's share goes to the guys. I buy retail.</text>

		<text>Stalker, you saved us! Our bunker would have met certain doom if you didn't step in to help. To show my gratitude, come to me for a free upgrade to your psy-helmet!</text>

		<text>&#191;Qu&#233; puedes decirme sobre el Quemador Cerebral?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_query_brain_scorcher">
		<text>Hmm, well...we still have much to learn, but I suppose it won't hurt to share what little we know with you. The Brain Scorcher seems to emit an invasive frequency that affects the mind of any who journey too close to Pripyat's center, the NPP or the wrong side of the Red Forest. Parece invadir la mente de cualquiera que viaje demasiado cerca. Los s&#237;ntomas incluyen migra&#241;as, alucinaciones, visi&#243;n de t&#250;nel y sin sonar poco profesional, zombificaci&#243;n. If I had to give a scientific estimation, I'd identify the Brain Scorcher as a remote psy-transmitter, though I'd have to conduct more invasive research before fully settling on that conclusion.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_player_query_psi_helmet">
		<text>Professor, I need a psy-protection helmet. My task requires me to move through the Brain Scorcher's area, and without it, I won't be able to complete it.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="yan_stalker_sakharov_npc_query_psi_helmet">
		<text>I assume you understand the risk of going through these psychically volatile areas, do you?... Oh, alright, I believe you do. You wouldn't ask me about it otherwise. Well, there has been this one model we've been working on carefully, but it remains unfinished, and it lacks final calibrations. We can give you the psy-helmet right now as it is for a humble sum of 10,000 RU, but then you'd have to deal with the risk of using untested hardware! There's one more possibility, though: we can speed up the calibration progress, but that would require us to use more funds, and for you to wait. Le costar&#237;a alrededor de 17.500 RU. If you are willing to part with such a sum, we'll begin utilizing it immediately to finish our calibrations, which should take approximately two days, give or take.</text>

		<text>You don't know what relief this brings to me and my colleagues. Letting us finish the final calibrations will greatly minimize the risk of injury, and we really wouldn't want to feel guilty of supplying you with untested gear... So, since you've already provided financial aid to our cause, a final calibration should cost you about 8,000 RU, and you'll need to wait approximately two days.</text>

		<text>Anything interesting happening in the scientific community lately?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_1">

	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_2">
		<text>There is an old hypothesis that Snorks are the next stage of human evolution. Even after procuring tissue samples, the topic is hotly debated.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_3">
		<text>We recently conducted some fascinating experiments on Bloodsuckers that...on second thought, it's probably better you don't know.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_4">
		<text>As an intellectual, you might appreciate this - our research has discovered that the so called "eye" of the Flesh is also equipped with...olfactory receptors! Not only can they see out their eyes, but also smell out of them! Isn't that fascinating?</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_5">
		<text>Have you seen the latest batch of mutant samples that were brought in? We've been transplanting as many as we can onto...voluntary assistants. We may be on the verge of starting a craze!</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_6">
		<text>We've done it! We've finally managed to create the rare Pellicle artefact under laboratory conditions! It is a breakthrough truly worthy of a Nobel Prize!</text>

	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_7">
		<text>Some of our colleagues have taken to eating cooked mutant meat as a way to test the effect of mutated protein on the human body. I don't know why they don't simply pay the 100 Rads a visit instead.</text>
	</string>
	<string id="st_yan_stalker_sakharov_life_8">
		<text>The Urchin artefact has allowed us to make potent anti-radiation medication. Chances are you may have benefitted from our research several times already.</text>
